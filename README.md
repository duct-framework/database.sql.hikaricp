# Duct database.sql.hikaricp [![Build Status](https://github.com/duct-framework/database.sql.hikaricp/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/duct-framework/database.sql.hikaricp/actions/workflows/test.yml)

[Integrant][] methods for connecting to a SQL database from the
[Duct][] framework using [HikariCP][], an efficient connection pool.

[integrant]: https://github.com/weavejester/integrant
[duct]:      https://github.com/duct-framework/duct
[hikaricp]:  https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP

## Installation

Add the following dependency to your deps.edn file:

    org.duct-framework/database.sql.hikaricp {:mvn/version "0.7.0"}

Or to your Leiningen project file:

    [org.duct-framework/database.sql.hikaricp "0.7.0"]

## Usage

This library depends on [database.sql][] and provides the
`:duct.database.sql/hikaricp` key, which is derived from
`:duct.database/sql`.

The key takes the same [config options][] as HikariCP (but as keywords,
rather than setters), and returns a `duct.database.sql.Boundary` record
that contains a DataSource.

```edn
{:duct.database.sql/hikaricp {:jdbcUrl "jdbc:sqlite:db/example.sqlite"}}
```
